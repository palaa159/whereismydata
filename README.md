Where is my Data (TBC) is a web-based real-time datatracker.
THe project began from the author's curiousity; we surf a lot of websites everyday 
but do we know where exactly are those data coming from?

Where is my Data is an attempt to track all incoming and outgoing tcp:80 (HTTP) requests and responses
within a network and visualize them in a real world map. The project can be scaled from an individual sense
to a community sense.
